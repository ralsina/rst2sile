What is rst2SILE?
-----------------

It's a command to convert reStructuredText to PDFs via `SILE. <http://sile-typesetter.org>`__

Frustrated with the reliance on LaTeX exhibited by most other PDF-from-markup tools, I googled
for some modern alternatives, and found SILE. Not only does it produce quality output, but you
can learn most of it in a couple of hours, is much easier to generate than LaTeX, and is
quite hackable in a semi-reasonable language (Lua). Really, SILE is a gem, and it worries me
that it seems nobody has heard of it.

So, ``rst2sile`` eats a ``.rst`` file, and spits out a ``.sil`` file, which you feed to SILE
and you end up with a PDF.

How to use it?
--------------

Basic usage::

   rst2sile foo.rst foo.sil ; sile foo.sil

Not so basic usage::

   rst2sile --help

How do I style the output?
--------------------------

With the goal of making it as easy as possible to customize, rst2sile supports a subset of CSS.

* It only supports "," as a selector connector. So this works::

     foo, bar { }

  But this doesn't::

     foo > bar {}
     foo bar {}

* It supports element selectors (all listed in the provided styles.css)
* It supports class selectors
* It doesn't support margins for inline elements such as classes in roles, or syntax highlight.
* Sizes, such as ``font-size`` or ``margin-top`` can be expressed in the usual units but instead of "%"
  it's recommended to use "%fw / %fh" (percentage of frame width/height) "%pw / %ph" (percentage of 
  page width/height)
* It only supports the following properties:

  * font-family
  * font-size
  * font-style
  * font-weight (has to be a number)
  * text-indent
  * text-align
  * margin-left
  * margin-right
  * margin-top
  * margin-bottom
  * language (for hyphenation. Special value "und" means no language)
  * script (for hyphenation and layout)
  * color

Motivation, in the form of exasperated Q&A
------------------------------------------

**What do I want?**

I want to be able to write docs using some reasonable markup (like reStructuredText) and produce
a PDF while being able to configure things like fonts and page layout.

**Why PDF?**

Because it's a format where I control the layout, and as long as anyone can open it I can trust that
he will see it in a reasonable manner.

**Why not (whatever other format)?**

Probably because:

* It would not be trivial to open for some people.
* It would not look exactly the way I want it to look.
* Some other reason.

**Why not use rst2latex.py?**

Because it uses LaTex and as soon as I want to do something *crazy* like changing the font (whoa) or
the paper size (whoohoo) I need to learn LaTex.

**Why not pandoc?**

See previous question.

**Why not LaTeX?**

Because it's not a reasonable markup.

**Why not markdown?**

Because it's too limited.

**Why not pandoc with markdown?**

Because it's LaTeX **and** markdown.

**Why not LibreOffice and print to a PDF?**

Because yeech?

**Why not HTML+CSS and print to a PDF?**

Because FFS why would a human want to write HTML+CSS?

**Why not reStructuredText and generate HTML and print to PDF?**

For the holy third left hand of Shiva, that is crazytalk.

**Why not rst2pdf?**

Well, glad you ask! Because I wrote it 10 years ago and I can't believe it's still, after years of becoming
abandonware, still one of the easiest ways to turn markup into PDFs without having to install 700MB of obscure
1980s code to implement **another different more complicated markup.**

Also, because I have become a much better programmer over the last 10 years, and therefore it *pains* me to see
all the problems rst2pdf has.

**So, what do you want to use, smartass?**

I want to use something that, apparently, doesn't exist. Therefore, I wrote this **new** piece of software.
